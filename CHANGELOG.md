## [0.1.9] - 2024-09-27

### Removed
* removed stub files for `torch` from ./stubs folder.  I left them by mistake. They were not meant to be part of the template (and were anyway work in progress).


## [0.1.8] - 2024-09-24

### Changed
* merged latest learnings gained in https://github.com/dnv-innersource/mvf repository, aiming to have `python_project_template` represent latest best practice.


## [0.1.7] - 2024-09-19

### Changed
* Changed from `pip`/`tox` to `uv` as package manager

### Added
* Added `mypy` as static type checker (in addition to `pyright`)
